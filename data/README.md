### Data Folder

This folder contains all references, metadata, and supporting information for the datasets used in the Demand Planning and Forecasting project.

**📌 About the Dataset**

The project uses the **Rossmann Store Sales dataset** from Kaggle, which contains daily sales records for over 1,000 retail stores.

Because of dataset size the raw data is not uploaded directly to this repository.  
Instead, this folder includes:
- Links to the original dataset
- Data dictionaries and field descriptions
- Notes on preprocessing steps
- Any sample or derived datasets (small CSVs) that are safe to upload

**📝 Notes**
The full dataset will be loaded and processed inside the notebooks stored in the `notebooks/` folder. Any transformed versions of the data (e.g., cleaned or feature-engineered CSVs) will be saved through Colab and referenced in subsequent notebooks.
